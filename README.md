About
-------------

RapidNet is an open-source software written in CUDA-C++ involving open-source libraries (cuBLAS and rapidjson) which allows the easy design of stochastic model predictive controllers for drinking water networks taking into account the volatility associated with water demands and price uncertainty in a deregulated bid-based energy market.

Highlights:
 
  * Efficient operating management of drinking water networks
  * Uncertainty on demands and electricity prices
  * Mitigation of the volatility in electricity cost
  * Very fast Stochastic Model Predictive Control
  * Parallelization on NVIDIA Graphics Processing Units (GPU)
